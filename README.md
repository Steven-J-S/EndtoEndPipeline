# EndtoEndPipeline
End to End Pipeline of Application Development in Python.

# Project
This project is a practice exercise in accomplishing the full development lifecycle of a simple application.

## Application
This application helps calculate the cumulative profit of compounded interest on an initially invested dollar amount.

## Lifecycle
The lifecycle exists of several steps.
1. Creation: create a python module that contains the application
2. Repository: make .git repository for version control
3. Programming: continue improving the functionality of the application
    - Exception handling for robustness
    - Use a .git branch to add new features
    - Refactor and modularize the code for clarity
    - Performance testing to find time/memory bottlenecks in the code
    - Adding documentation for clarity
4. Unit testing: make a pipeline for testing the application.
5. Distribution: build a distribution for a new version of the application.
6. CI/CD: Continue updating the code and adding new features while updating the distribution.
7. Deploying: Deploy the application on a scalable platform using Docker and Kubernetes.

Although it's called a lifecycle is not necessarily cyclical. Most steps follow logically from the previous step, however, oftentimes steps will be reiterated before continuing to the next step.
